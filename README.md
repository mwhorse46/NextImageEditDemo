# Photography Portfolio

Project made with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs) and the [UnSplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers).

The design is responsive with a focus on mobile first. All the static content is within the public directory.

The `Work` route displays pictures from the UnSplash API. Each time the `Work` route is visited, new pictures are pulled randomly and resized into a grid
